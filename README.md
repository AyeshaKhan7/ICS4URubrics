# ICS4URubrics
Rubrics for ICS4U course

At this time each assessment is 10% if more sections are completed student will be given form to fill out to apply for assessment.

Assessments will only be graded once and there will be one re-grading opportunity where the grade will move up or down 1%. That will then have to be accepted by the student.

**Be aware that all work done in this course should be able to be seen on GitHub. Your use of GitHub(and Git) is essential to demostrate proficiency in this course.**

(Semi-Mandatory,)
### 5. Micro Controller Course (10%)
* 4. Developer completes all tasks assigned to her/him. Documentation logs progress and shows interest in task.

* 2. Developer completes some of the tasks but has no documentation and code does not function.
* 1. Developer completes some tasks but without any evidence to show for it.

(Mandatory)
### 6. 20time(10%)
* 4. Student has completed all of their logs and demostrates strong project management techniques through use of GitHub. Documentation, and use of GitHub intracacies not discussed in class are present. A natural connection to computer science is present. The presentation demonstrates that the student learned a variety of lessons from their experiance.
* 3. Student has completed all of their logs on time. Use of Wiki and Project tab are on-going. Presentation shows that a variety of learning was present.
* 2. Student has completed some/most of their logs on time. Little documentation. Presentation was lacking in preparation.
* 1. Student has not completed logs in general. No documention. Presentation did not occur.

(Mandatory)
### 7. Coding Challenge(10%)
* 4. Team has constructed a webpage(ghpages), used social media, to promote their coding challenge. Each person has a contributed one original creationof the coding challenge to the repository. Other people have tried and contributed to their coding challenge through submissions, links, comments, pull requests, etc. to show what they made from their inspiration.
* 3 THe coding challenge was mostly successful.
* 2 The coding challenge was successful in some aspects. People listened
* 1 The coding challenge was attempted and an attempt was made but was unsuccessful.

(Can be used to replace Micro-Controller course, or improve grade)
### Extra. Khan Academy (10% each section completed) (i.e. more HTML, JQuery, SQL, Games, etc.)
More to come on this but essentially each section is 10% and completion of all challenges and projects are required to reach level 4.

### 8. Javascript Syntax & Style (10%) [self-assessemnt then evaluation of self-assessment]

* 4. Developer uses elegant and idiomatic Javascript to accomplish common tasks. Demonstrates solid understanding of function passing and manipulation. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* 3. Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* 2. Developer can accomplish basic tasks with Javascript but implementation is largely copy/pasted or non-idiomatic. Developer is not confident in what every line of the code is doing or cannot speak to the choices made.
* 1. Developer can manipulate Javascript syntax but implementation is buggy or inconsistent.
* 0. Developer shows little or no understanding of Javascript syntax and idioms

### 9. Workflow(10%) [self-assessment then evaluation of self-assessment]

* 4. The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
* 3. The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
* 2. The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.
* 1. The developer commited the code to version control in only a few commits. The evaluator cannot determine the evolution of the application.
* 0. The application was not checked into version control.


### 10. GitHub Profile(10%) [self-assessment then evaluation of self-assement]

* 4. The developer has used GitHubPages to share their creative coding projects. (See: http://nature.doublepi.me/info for inspiration, and create your own page via:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HPYsDTk17A Coding Train tutorial)
* 3. All repositories are created and visualizations(pictures and/or gifs) are present to show what creative coding assignments are present. No website necessary. Documentation states what is in repository(aka: no surprises).
* 2. All repositories are created but it is hard to figure out what has been completed from ReadMe.md and/or files are not named with correct extensions.
* 1. Profile shows lack of care and but some work is present.

Your top 100% will be taken. Some of these grades will only be given if a form is submitted.
